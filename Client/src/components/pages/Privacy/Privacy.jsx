            this information back to the applicable Site each time your browser
            requests a page from the Site. “Web beacons” are small pieces of
            code placed on websites used to collect advertising metrics, such as
            counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. We
            may also use cookies or web beacons to measure aggregate web
